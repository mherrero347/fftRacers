## Things To Do ##

FEATURE CHANGE = make overheating cause shaking in both racers at the same time, which disincentivizes both players to yell too loudly!


### Now ####
    - racer
        - implement acceleration-velocity based movement

### Next ####
    - check for collisions
        - maybe store a vector of all points put into the volume walls as they're put in?
    - implement gain power-up lanes
    - implement multi-microphone input

### In A Bit ####
